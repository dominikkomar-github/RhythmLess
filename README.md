# RhythmLess

The project is a PC rhythm game where the user has to click arrows on their keyboard corresponsing to the direction the notes are going, when notes touch the walls that's when the player has to click, if they miss notes three times, it's game over. There are 3 levels, easy, medium and hard, the user can access each level through a menu.

I've uploaded a few scripts that made this project possible.
